The goal of binGroup2 is to provide methods for the group testing identification and estimation problems. Methods for the group testing identification problem: 1) Operating characteristics (e.g., expected number of tests) for commonly used hierarchical and array-based algorithms, and 2) Optimal testing configurations for these same algorithms. Methods for the group testing estimation problem: 1) Estimation and inference procedures for an overall prevalence, and 2) Regression modeling for commonly used hierarchical and array-based algorithms.

## Installation

You can install the development version of binGroup2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bdhitt/binGroup2")
```
